<p>By this email, we acknowledge receipt of your application. At this time, we would like to reiterate the objectives of Elina:There is a strong need to spread awareness about inclusion and address a large number of persons that are currently not served meaningfully.Elina is an advisory and referral center, aiming to proliferate inclusion and bring more equity in society. 
Elina is a curated and growing network of professionals in the field of inclusion &disability. Our network includes Occupation Therapists, Speech Language Pathologists, Art therapists, Psychiatrists, Psychologists & Special Educators.
</p>
<h4>Methodology :</h4>
<p>
The underlying learning is through all the evidence-based research-work that we have done at HLC the Social Incubation Centre.
Our philosophy is that 'Any child can learn'. We can ensure that no child will be left behind if -
</p>
<p>
• We identify his/her needs
</p>
<p>
• Connect him/her to a team with the right expertise
</p>
<p>
• Establish proper communication channels among the stakeholders
</p>
<p>
• Coordinate the child’s care & development
</p>
<p>
Please note that enrollment in Elina or availing services from Elina does NOT relate to admission into HLC School . Elina provides a flexible learning program for your child that is tailor-made to suit his/her needs. 
</p>
<p>
It will involve the child learning at different locations as per expert availability and the child's own needs.We are here to help.
