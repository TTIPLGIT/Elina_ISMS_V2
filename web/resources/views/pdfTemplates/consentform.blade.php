    </div>
    <p dir="ltr" style="font-family:Barlow Semi Condensed !important;">Welcome to Elina! We are excited to join you in your journey with your neurodivergent child. Please carefully review and sign the following consent form to understand our services and how we can support your child's development.</p>
    <p dir="ltr" style="font-family:Barlow Semi Condensed !important;">Our Vision: "Diversity makes nature &ndash; and society &ndash; stronger, more resilient, and more interesting. Neurodiversity is no different."</p>
    <p dir="ltr" style="font-family:Barlow Semi Condensed !important;">Our Mission: "Our goal is to co-create an ever more empathetic and inclusive society that embraces the potential and wonder of neurodiversity. We do so by designing and implementing customized programs that facilitate the inclusion of neurodiverse individuals at home, school, workplace, and every environment that they are part of; creating a roadmap for parents to understand the path ahead in this unplanned journey; and pooling in resources and information to amplify the work that is being done towards inclusion, taking a lifespan approach."</p>
    <p dir="ltr" style="font-family:Barlow Semi Condensed !important;">About Elina:</p>
    <p dir="ltr" style="font-family:Barlow Semi Condensed !important;">We are an advisory and referral centre that provides valuable guidance towards independence and learning for your child.</p>
    <p dir="ltr" style="font-family:Barlow Semi Condensed !important;">We do not directly influence admission in any schools, or provide any direct therapy or intervention session, medication, transport, or logistic services.</p>
    <p dir="ltr" style="font-family:Barlow Semi Condensed !important;">Our philosophy is that "Any child can learn." We can ensure that no child will be left behind if we identify their strengths and challenges, recommend the right learning environments, connect them to a team with the right expertise, establish proper communication channels among stakeholders, and coordinate the child's care and development.</p>
    <p dir="ltr" style="font-family:Barlow Semi Condensed !important;">Our SAIL program helps identify your child's strengths and stretches, recommend the right learning environments, and connect them to a team with the right expertise.</p>
    <p dir="ltr" style="font-family:Barlow Semi Condensed !important;">We use our CoMPASS program to make your child's progress visible and coordinate their care and development.</p>
    <p dir="ltr" style="font-family:Barlow Semi Condensed !important;">We handhold and shadow parents through this journey by providing them with a structured and objective process that highlights the impact of consistency and awareness.</p>
    <p dir="ltr" style="font-family:Barlow Semi Condensed !important;">We monitor, design and alter your child's environments through the impactful and focused work done by professionals like therapists, special educators, and teachers.</p>
    <p dir="ltr" style="font-family:Barlow Semi Condensed !important;">By signing up with us, you understand and agree that we do not provide any direct therapy or intervention sessions.</p>
    <p dir="ltr" style="font-family:Barlow Semi Condensed !important;">We pool resources and information to amplify the work being done towards inclusion, taking a lifespan approach.</p>

    <p dir="ltr" style="font-family:Barlow Semi Condensed !important;">Thank you for your understanding and cooperation in creating an empathetic and inclusive society that embraces the potential and wonder of neurodiversity.</p>
